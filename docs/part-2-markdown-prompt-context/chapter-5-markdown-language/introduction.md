# Introduction to Markdown

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language created by John Gruber in 2004. It allows you to write using plain text format that converts to structurally valid HTML.

## Why Markdown Matters for AI

AI systems are trained on vast amounts of markdown content. When you communicate in markdown:

- The AI recognizes structure immediately
- Formatting intentions are clear
- Code and prose are clearly distinguished
- Specifications are unambiguous

## Basic Syntax

### Text Formatting

```markdown
**Bold text** for emphasis
*Italic text* for slight emphasis
`code` for inline code
```

### Paragraphs

Separate paragraphs with a blank line. Single line breaks are typically ignored.

## Getting Started

1. Open any text editor
2. Save your file with `.md` extension
3. Start writing with markdown syntax
4. Preview in any markdown viewer

## Practice Exercise

Create a simple markdown document describing your current project:

1. Add a title with `#`
2. Add sections with `##`
3. Include a bulleted list
4. Add some **bold** and *italic* text
