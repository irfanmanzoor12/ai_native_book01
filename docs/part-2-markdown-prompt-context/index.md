# Part 2: Markdown, Prompt & Context Engineering

## Overview

This part covers the three foundational skills for effective AI collaboration:

1. **Markdown**: The universal language for structured communication with AI
2. **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting effective instructions for AI systems
3. **Context Engineering**: Managing information flow to optimize AI performance

## Why These Skills Matter

In AI-driven development, your ability to communicate clearly with AI systems determines your productivity. These aren't just "nice to have" skills—they're the core competencies that separate effective AI collaborators from those who struggle.

## What You'll Learn

### Chapter 5: Markdown - The Language of AI

- Why markdown is the lingua franca of AI development
- Structuring documents for AI consumption
- Headings, lists, code blocks, and links
- Creating effective specifications in markdown

### Chapter 6: Prompt Engineering for AIDD

- Understanding how AI agents process instructions
- Writing clear commands and specifications
- Providing context effectively
- Validating and iterating on AI outputs
- The QDD (Question-Driven Development) roleplay technique

### Chapter 7: Context Engineering

- Understanding context windows and their limitations
- The six components of AIDD context
- Progressive context loading strategies
- Context compression and isolation techniques
- Claude Code vs Gemini CLI context approaches

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with text editing
- Access to an AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, or similar)
- Willingness to practice iteratively

## Outcomes

By completing Part 2, you will be able to:

- Write well-structured markdown documents
- Craft prompts that produce consistent, high-quality outputs
- Manage context effectively across long development sessions
- Communicate specifications clearly to AI systems
