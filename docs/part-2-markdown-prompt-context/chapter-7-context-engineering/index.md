# Chapter 7: Context Engineering for AIDD

## Overview

Context engineering is the practice of managing what information AI systems have access to during development tasks.

## Why Context Engineering?

AI models have limited context windows. How you fill that window determines output quality:

- **Too little context**: AI makes wrong assumptions
- **Too much context**: Important details get lost
- **Wrong context**: Irrelevant information confuses the model
- **Right context**: Optimal outputs with minimal iteration
