# Understanding AI Agents

## What is an AI Agent?

An AI agent is a system that:
- Receives instructions (prompts)
- Processes them using a language model
- Takes actions based on the instructions
- Returns results or asks for clarification

## How AI Agents Process Instructions

1. **Tokenization**: Your text is broken into tokens
2. **Context Assembly**: Your prompt + system context
3. **Inference**: The model generates a response
4. **Action**: Tools may be called (file edits, commands, etc.)

## Types of AI Coding Agents

### Chat-Based Agents
- ChatGPT, Claude.ai
- Turn-by-turn conversation
- No direct file access

### IDE-Integrated Agents
- GitHub Copilot, Cursor
- Code completion in context
- Access to open files

### CLI Agents
- Claude Code, Gemini CLI
- Full codebase access
- Execute terminal commands
- Autonomous task execution

## Key Differences from Traditional Tools

| Aspect | Traditional Tools | AI Agents |
|--------|------------------|-----------|
| Input | Exact commands | Natural language |
| Output | Deterministic | Probabilistic |
| Context | Limited | Extensive |
| Learning | None | Improves with context |

## Working Effectively with Agents

1. **Be Specific**: Vague prompts get vague results
2. **Provide Context**: Help the agent understand your situation
3. **Iterate**: Refine based on outputs
4. **Verify**: Always review AI-generated code
