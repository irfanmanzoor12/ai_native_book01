# Why Traditional CS Education Falls Short

## The Curriculum Lag Phenomenon

Universities operate on a 2-4 year revision cycle, while AI development evolves every 3-6 months. The disconnect means students graduate with outdated knowledge.

## Five Critical Gaps

### 1. AI Collaboration & Prompt Engineering
Traditional programs emphasize writing code from scratch; modern practice requires effective collaboration with AI assistants.

### 2. Specification-Driven Development
Academic instruction favors trial-and-error coding, while professional AI-augmented work demands comprehensive upfront specifications.

### 3. Agent Orchestration
Programs teach implementation skills but not how to decompose problems for AI agents or manage agent workflows.

### 4. Modern Context Protocols (MCP)
Emerging as a fundamental standard for connecting AI agents to data sources, yet absent from most curricula.

### 5. Real-World Problem Solving
Academics emphasize textbook exercises; industry requires handling ambiguous requirements and production-quality development.

## Recommended Path

Pursue **hybrid learning**: gain theoretical foundations from universities while supplementing with modern AI development practices.
