# Chapter 4: The Nine Pillars of AI-Driven Development

## What is AIDD?

AI-Driven Development (AIDD) represents a fundamental shift where AI tools are central to the development process, not just assistants.

## The Nine Pillars

### 1. AI CLI & Coding Agents
Command-line tools like Claude Code and Gemini CLI that understand context and execute tasks autonomously.

### 2. Markdown as Programming Language
Using structured markdown for specifications that AI can interpret and implement.

### 3. MCP Standard (Model Context Protocol)
The emerging standard for connecting AI agents to data sources and tools.

### 4. AI-First IDEs
Development environments designed around AI collaboration (Cursor, Windsurf, etc.).

### 5. Linux Universal Development Environment
Standardized environments that AI agents can reliably operate in.

### 6. Test-Driven Development
Writing tests first becomes even more critical when AI generates implementations.

### 7. Spec-Driven Development
Comprehensive specifications guide AI implementation and serve as documentation.

### 8. Composable Vertical Skills
Specialized AI capabilities that can be combined for complex solutions.

### 9. Universal Cloud Deployment Platforms
Simplified deployment through platforms like Vercel, Railway, and Fly.io.

## The M-Shaped Developer

Modern developers need depth in multiple areas:
- Domain expertise (vertical)
- AI orchestration skills (horizontal)
- System design (architectural)

## Why All Nine Matter

Each pillar reinforces the others. Weakness in one limits the effectiveness of all.

## Why a New Paradigm?

Traditional development assumed human implementation. AIDD assumes AI implementation with human oversight and direction.
